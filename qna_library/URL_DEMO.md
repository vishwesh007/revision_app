# URL Conversion Demo

## Test URLs for Java Interview Questions

### Option 1: GitHub UI URL (What you copy from browser)
```
https://github.com/vishwesh007/revision_app/blob/main/qna_library/java_interview_questions.json
```
âœ… **This now works!** App automatically converts it.

### Option 2: Raw URL (Direct content)
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishwesh007/revision_app/main/qna_library/java_interview_questions.json
```
âœ… **This also works!** Use whichever is easier for you.
