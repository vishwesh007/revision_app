## 🎓 SM-2 Algorithm Implementation

The app uses the canonical SuperMemo 2 algorithm:

### Algorithm Flow

1. **New card**: Repetition = 0, Easiness = 2.5, Interval = 0
2. **First review**: Interval = 1 day (if quality ≥ 3)
3. **Second review**: Interval = 6 days (if quality ≥ 3)
4. **Subsequent reviews**: Interval = previous_interval × easiness_factor
5. **Failed recall** (quality < 3): Reset to day 1

### Quality Scoring

- **5**: Perfect recall (fully correct, confident)
- **4**: Correct after hesitation
- **3**: Correct with difficulty
- **2**: Incorrect but familiar
- **1**: Vague recall
- **0**: Complete blackout

### Easiness Factor

- Formula: `EF' = EF + 0.1 - (5 - q) × (0.08 + (5 - q) × 0.02)`
- Floor: 1.3 (minimum easiness)
- Default: 2.5 (for new cards)
- Increases with higher quality scores
- Decreases with lower quality scores
