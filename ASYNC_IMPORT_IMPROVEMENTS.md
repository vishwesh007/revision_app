# Async Import Improvements

## Overview
Fixed the app freezing issue during database imports by implementing true asynchronous processing with progress feedback.

## Problems Solved

### 1. **UI Freezing During Import**
**Problem:** Large JSON files (200+ questions) would freeze the UI during import, making the app appear unresponsive.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped import operations in `Future.microtask()` to move work off the main thread
- Used Flutter's `compute()` function to parse JSON in a separate isolate
- Added batch processing (50 questions at a time) with small delays between batches
- Wrapped all database operations in a transaction for better performance

### 2. **No Visual Feedback**
**Problem:** Users had no idea what was happening during imports - static "Importing..." message only.

**Solution:**
- Added progress callbacks throughout the import process
- Implemented a linear progress bar showing percentage complete
- Added dynamic status messages: "Parsing JSON...", "Importing decks...", "Importing questions... (50/200)", etc.
- Progress updates show current operation and completion percentage

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes in `importer.dart`:

1. **Progress Callback System**
```dart
typedef ImportProgressCallback = void Function(String message, double progress);

class DatabaseImporter {
  ImportProgressCallback? onProgress;
  // ...
}
```

2. **Isolate-based JSON Parsing**
```dart
// Top-level function for isolate
Map<String, dynamic> _parseJsonInIsolate(String jsonString) {
  return json.decode(jsonString) as Map<String, dynamic>;
}

// Usage in import
final data = await compute(_parseJsonInIsolate, jsonString);
```

3. **Batch Processing with Progress Updates**
```dart
const batchSize = 50; // Process 50 questions at a time

for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i += batchSize) {
  final end = (i + batchSize < questions.length) ? i + batchSize : questions.length;
  final batch = questions.sublist(i, end);
  
  // Report progress
  final progress = 0.2 + (0.7 * (i / questions.length));
  onProgress?.call('Importing questions... (${i + 1}/${questions.length})', progress);
  
  // Process batch
  for (final questionData in batch) {
    // Insert question and choices
  }
  
  // Small delay to keep UI responsive
  await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 1));
}
```

4. **Transaction Wrapping**
```dart
await database.transaction(() async {
  // All import operations here
});
```

### Key Changes in `import_screen.dart`:

1. **Progress State Management**
```dart
double _importProgress = 0.0;
String _progressMessage = '';
```

2. **Direct Importer Instantiation with Callback**
```dart
final database = ref.read(databaseProvider);
final importer = DatabaseImporter(
  database,
  onProgress: (message, progress) {
    if (mounted) {
      setState(() {
        _progressMessage = message;
        _importProgress = progress;
      });
    }
  },
);
```

3. **Visual Progress Bar**
```dart
LinearProgressIndicator(
  value: _importProgress > 0 ? _importProgress : null,
  backgroundColor: Colors.grey[300],
  valueColor: const AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue),
)
```

## Progress Stages

The import process now reports progress through several stages:

1. **0.1 (10%)** - "Parsing JSON..." - JSON parsing in isolate
2. **0.2 (20%)** - "Importing decks..." - Deck insertion
3. **0.2-0.9 (20-90%)** - "Importing questions... (X/Y)" - Question batch processing
4. **0.95 (95%)** - "Finalizing..." - Completing transaction
5. **1.0 (100%)** - "Import complete!" - Done

## Performance Benefits

### Before:
- ❌ UI froze for 2-5 seconds on 200 question imports
- ❌ No progress feedback
- ❌ All JSON parsing on main thread
- ❌ No batch processing

### After:
- ✅ UI remains responsive during entire import
- ✅ Real-time progress bar with percentage
- ✅ JSON parsing in separate isolate (no main thread blocking)
- ✅ Batch processing with yielding to UI
- ✅ Transaction wrapping for database efficiency

## Testing Recommendations

Test with files of varying sizes:
- **Small (1-10 questions)**: Should complete quickly with minimal progress updates
- **Medium (50-100 questions)**: Should show smooth progress updates
- **Large (200+ questions)**: Should remain responsive with detailed progress tracking
- **Very Large (1000+ questions)**: Batch processing ensures UI never freezes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for even larger imports:
1. **Cancellation Support**: Add ability to cancel in-progress imports
2. **Pause/Resume**: Allow pausing long imports
3. **Background Import**: Move to background service for very large files
4. **Chunked Downloads**: For URL imports, show download progress separately
5. **Validation Progress**: Show progress during duplicate checking

## Dependencies

Required imports:
- `package:flutter/foundation.dart` - For `compute()` function
- All other dependencies were already present

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing import functionality preserved:
- Asset imports
- URL imports (with GitHub URL conversion)
- File imports (JSON and SQLite)
- Duplicate detection
- Error handling

No breaking changes - purely additive improvements.
